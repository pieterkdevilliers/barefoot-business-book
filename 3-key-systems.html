        <article>
            <div>
                <p>Clearly defined systems and processes are one of the keys to any successful business. When you are growing your business, the importance of your systems and processes is magnified, as you scale and expand your original business.</p>
                <p>Think of it like a picture on a balloon. When the balloon is small, the picture looks just fine, but as you blow up the balloon, all the cracks in the ink or lines not quite meeting up starts to become visible. Go far enough and the picture starts to be unrecognisable.</p>
                <p>The trick is to create the systems and processes now, as if your business is already scaled. Draw the picture as if the balloon is already blown up.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Where to start?</h3>
                <p>Start with the way you think about your business.</p>
                <p>In truth, your business needs only 3 key systems. Yes, these systems will be made up of different components, and as your business grows and your team expands, you may need to update or replace some of the elements, but your business will still function inside these 3 key systems.</p>
                <p>What are the 3 Key Systems I hear you ask. Good question, we’ll get to that.</p>
                <p>First, I want to share with you just 3 of the reasons for having clearly defined systems and processes in your business.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>1. You’ll be able to focus on growing your business.</h3>
                <p>With no discernable systems or processes in place, every day is a first day for your business. Neither you, your staff nor your customers will be sure how the day is going to go, and how things will be done.</p>
                <p>The real-world effect of this is more time spent fire-fighting, managing mistakes from your team and inbound customer service queries.</p>
                <p>By creating clear systems and processes in your business, you are able to create a minimum level of service and an undercurrent of activities which are there all day, every day.</p>
                <p>This means you only need to get involved when there is an anomaly, which will be another opportunity to improve your processes and systems.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>2. Look at the horizon, not your feet.</h3>
                <p>When everything in your business is manual and ‘on the hoof’, it is near impossible for you to do any planning or ‘big thinking’. All your time is taken up by dealing with ‘now’, and ‘now’ never ends. This means you are just treading water and trying to stay afloat, making no forward progress.</p>
                <p>What clearly thought-out and developed systems and automation gives you is the ability to look up, focus on the future, and actually make progress getting there.</p>
                <p>You’ll be in a position to create a business that ‘works’. A business that works for you, and produces results, with much less demand on your actual input and time.</p>
                <p>What do you do with this extra time? You plan for the future, because it won’t be like today.</p>
                <p>As Keith Cunningham states in his book, ‘The Road Less Stupid’: “You need to run the business that is generating income today, whilst at the same time building the business that will generate income in the future.”</p>
                <p>If you spend all day fire-fighting, this is impossible.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>3. New team members become assets to your business.</h3>
                <p>In most businesses, and most businesses are not successful, a new team member starting goes something like this:</p>
                <p><em>John, meet Sally, she’s been with us for a couple of years now.</em></p>
                <p><em>Sally, John is just starting, you can show him the ropes, right?</em></p>
                <p>And that is it.</p>
                <p>John’s only insight into how things are done in your business is what Sally tells him or shows him.</p>
                <p>John will have no real focus on what is expected of him, because he is spending his time trying to get to grips with a couple of different pieces of software. There is nothing to guide John on what he is meant to do when he shows up for work on a Monday morning, so he just focuses on the can that rattles the most.</p>
                <p>Before you know it, it is Friday, and John has still not learnt all that much about how he is helping to grow and build the business. Leaving it to John to figure out, means it can take up to six months before he is a profitable member of the team.</p>
                <p>With the right systems and processes in place, and some automation, John will know exactly what to focus on next, and be able to tell important from urgent.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Back to the 3 key systems</h2>
                <p>Every business you’ve ever come in contact with has the same three systems. Yes, there are smaller sub-systems and processes nested under each of these. However, focussing on the three key systems will allow you to remain focussed and make progress optimising your business sooner.</p>
                <h3>Lead Generation System</h3>
                <p>Your lead generation system has one job - allow people to raise their hand and declare their interest in your product or service. That’s it.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Digital Marketing</li>
                    <li>Print Ads</li>
                    <li>Branding</li>
                    <li>Blogs</li>
                    <li>Podcasts</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All of these are ways to get your business in front of the right kinds of people, and when they are ready and in need, it should be very easy for them to raise their hand and indicate their interest.</p>
                <p>Prospects can raise their hand through:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Completing a form on your website</li>
                    <li>Starting a conversation with a chat tool on your website</li>
                    <li>Commenting on your business' social media pages</li>
                    <li>Respoinding to an email</li>
                    <li>Direct inbound phone call</li>
                    <li>Returning a direct mail form</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The key is that you need several options that make it as easy as possible for someone to get in touch in a way they are comfortable with.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Client Acquisition System</h3>
                <p>This system is a bit like a sausage machine or a factory - Take the raw materials (Leads) and process or convert them into fulfilled output (Clients).</p>
                <p>The Client Acquisition System works from the moment someone has raised their hand up to the point where money or contracts change hands.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Automated email follow-up</li>
                    <li>Social media targeting</li>
                    <li>Direct mail</li>
                    <li>Telesales</li>
                    <li>Face to face meetings</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All of these functions sit inside your Client Acquisition System, it is like the heart at the centre of your business. If it stops pumping, you’ll have no sales. At the same time, if you stop supplying it with leads, it will grind to a halt.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Client Fulfilment System</h3>
                <p>This is simply how you do what you do.</p>
                <p>The distinction though is that the aim is not to just fulfil the service or order. Your aim is to have every client or customer feel fulfilled by the overall experience of doing business with you.</p>
                <p>Here using the right tools for your business becomes critical. Up to this point, you’ve not had to focus on the specifics of your business. (Running Facebook ads for all businesses use pretty much the same tools and processes)</p>
                <p>You want to ensure you are not running your business with software created by someone who knows nothing about your business. Don’t shape your business to fit around a single tool or piece of software. Just because you have a hammer, doesn’t mean everything is a nail.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>But my business is so much more complex!</h2>
                <p>As you will know, business is more complex than a three step process. There are several systems and processes nested inside each of these three key systems.</p>
                <p>Think of it this way though:</p>
                <p>A security and safety system is a single integrated system. It would be made up of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Burglar Alarm System</li>
                    <li>CCTV System</li>
                    <li>Fire Detection System</li>
                    <li>Flood Detection System</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each of those are made up of components, but together they function as a single security and safety system.</p>
                <p>Looking at your business through the lens of the three key systems, you’ll avoid getting stuck in all the micro details before you’ve even started.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>How do you optimise and automate these three systems?</h3>
                <p>First, identify where the lines and responsibilities are within your business, mapped onto these three key systems.</p>
                <p>Keep in mind that right now, some of your team might work across more than one of these systems. Be clear though, any of the tasks and functions they perform, will only ever sit in one of these three systems.</p>
                <p>Work on the systems in reverse. It sounds counterintuitive at first, but you need to start by optimising and automating your Client Fulfilment System. This helps to ensure that when you strike gold with your Lead Generation System, your business can cope, and the wheels don’t come off.</p>
                <p>Next you move to the Client Acquisition System followed by the Lead Generation System.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Recap</h3>
                <p>Three key systems, with three specific functions:</p>
                <p>Lead Generation System - Allow people to raise their hand</p>
                <p>Client Acquisition System - Turn leads into clients and customers</p>
                <p>Customer Fulfilment System - Get the work done. Deliver to your clients.</p>
                <p>Focus on these, and you’ll be well on your way to building a successful business you can scale.</p>
