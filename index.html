            <h2>Is your business holding you prisoner?</h2>
            <p>If you, like many business owners, are swamped by the day to day, trying to find a different way to work. If you feel that your business is running you or taking over your life, then this book is for you.</p>
            <p><em>Barefoot Business</em> will show you how big businesses deliver results, handle the small stuff and still stay in control. You'll learn how companies like Porsche, McDonalds and Apple are able to run extremely efficient and profitable businesses, on what seems like auto-pilot, with staff far less 'skilled' or 'qualified' than you might expect. More importantly, you'll learn how you can do it too!</p>

            <p>When you read this book, you will:</p>

            <h2>Foreword to Barefoot Business</h2>
        </div>
        <div id="foreword-left">
            <p>If you're a dabbler, don't go near this book.</p>
            <p>Put it back on the shelf. Now. </p>
            <p>Don't buy it. </p>
            <p>Truth is, most people are dabblers. We dip in and out. We give things a try. This book is useless if you're giving business a try. </p>
            <p>Fundamentally, the premise of this book is absolutely sound. Businesses really do only need three systems in order to flourish and thrive. And I am not aware of a better book anywhere that articulates what those systems are, how they can work best, and crucially, what to do to put them in place.</p>
            <p>But it won't happen if you're a dabbler.</p>
            <p>Implementation of what Pieter writes about here will require commitment, resolve…</p>
            <p>…and thought.</p>
            <p>I've always found it fascinating how little most people think.</p>
            <p>I mean properly think.</p>
            <p>Ever since I met the author, way back in 2011, he stood out as a thinker. He sat around the table in one of my Mastermind groups alongside guys with bigger businesses, higher turnover and more profit. But no one thought more than Pieter.</p>
            <p>He was never the loudest person in the room at those meetings, but when he spoke, we all listened. And we all paid attention because he was – always - remarkably well-thought through. And you’ll see exactly what I mean once you get stuck into this book.</p>
            <p>Pieter has a knack for seeing things the way they really are. And his wonderfully simplistic,  endearing, but devastatingly straightforward,  articulation of what, to him, seems obvious, has helped many hundreds of businesses within the Entrepreneurs Circle to achieve way more than they would have done without his input.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="foreword-right">
            <p>And that's what you can expect this book will do for you.</p>
            <p>Providing you're not a dabbler.</p>
            <p>If you're prepared to follow Pieter's instructions and read it twice, (who asks people to read their book twice!)  then the insights and structures that he provides here can - and will - have a profound and deep impact on your business.</p>
            <p>They will make you more profitable.</p>
            <p>They will give you more time.</p>
            <p>They will make your business more saleable. And more enjoyable.</p>
            <p>Your customers will get a significantly improved experience which, crucially, will be consistent.</p>
            <p>Your marketing will become properly effective and your staff more productive. Way more productive. Because that's what systems do.</p>
            <p>This book won't win a Nobel prize. And, truthfully, it won't be a bestseller either. Because most people will miss its significance and, anyway, most people won't be prepared to implement what's inside here and, without implementation, this book will be worthless.</p>
            <p>But for those who are serious about moving their business -and their lifestyle - towards where they want it to be, well this book just might be the most useful hundred pages or so that you've ever held in your hands. Providing you’re not a dabbler.</p>
            <p>Good luck.</p>
