            <h2>Don't buy it.</h2>
            <h2>Truth is, most people are dabblers. We dip in and out. We give things a try. This book is useless if you're giving business a try.</h2>
            <h2>Fundamentally, the premise of this book is absolutely sound. Businesses really do only need three systems in order to flourish and thrive. And I am not aware of a better book anywhere that articulates what those systems are, how they can work best, and crucially, what to do to put them in place.</h2>
