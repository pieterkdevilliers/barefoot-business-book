This is a website designed as an additional resource, in support of the book, Barefoot Business, published in 2017. The website features 'book intro', 'praise for Barefoot Business', 'foreword to Barefoot Business', 'author's bio', 'get in touch contact form', '3 key systems concept overview' and 'additional resource - podcast interview episodes`.

The aim of the website is to give the visitor an overview of the book and the key concept it is based on, with the options to discover more about the author via the podcast interview links, as well as the option to get in touch directly.



The business goals of this website are:

* Showcase the 3 Key Systems concept covered in Barefoot Business

* Give the visitor the option to get in touch with the author

* Allow the visitor to get to know the author more, through access to several podcast interviews



The customer visit this website to:

* Find out more about Barefoot Business

* Find out more about Pieter K de Viliers

* Contact the author with questions, or the opportunity to work together



# UX

A lot of the time, an author's books are hidden somewhere in a larger business or personal brand website. This can make it harder for the visitor to find information focussed on the book itself. This website is designed to focus attention on the book itself, and the topic it covers.


### Ideal client 

The ideal reader for Barefoot Business, and visitor to this site is: 

* Small to medium sized business owners

* Entrepreneurs

* Business or Team Managers



The project help clients to: 

* Discover the 3 Key Systems concept

* Learn more about Barefoot Business

* Get in touch with the author



### User stories: 

1.	I've heard of Barefoot Business, but would like more information before investing time in reading the book.

2.	I've heard of Barefoot Business, or even started reading it, but would like to learn more about the author.

3.	I've heard of Barefoot Business, or am reading it, and would like to get in contact with the author.



### Scope

To achieve the strategic goals, I included the following features in the website: 

* Header containing a simple title logo and the navigation menu containing, Home, 3 Key Systems and Get In Touch.

* Home page with an introduction to the book.

* Some praise quotes from readers, to support the positioning of the book.

* The foreword from the book, to draw the visitor into the book, even before they have a copy.

* A brief bio of the author.

* A contact form to send a message to the author.

* The 3 Key Systems page contains the same bio and contact form sections.

* The 3 Key Systems page contains a lengthy article, outlining the basic premise of the book, aiming to not only interest the visitor in the book, but deliver real value, even if they never get a copy of the book itself.

* The Get In Touch page contains the same bio and contact form sections as the other pages.

* In addition, the Get In Touch page also contains a collection of podcast interview episodes the author appeared on, for the visitor to explore.


## Structure Overview 

The website consists of three pages; Home (introducing the book, introducing the author, providing some praise for the book and a form with which the visitor can contact the author),  3 Key Systems (an indepth article outlining the main concept of the book), and Get In Touch (including the contact form as well as links to podcast interviews). 


# Features 

### Header

The header contains a simple text logo, as well as the navigation menu for the three pages of the website - Home, 3 Key Systems and Get In Touch. This header is consistant across all the pages of the site.



### Footer

The footer, used across all three pages of the site, contains a simple copyright notice and links to 4 social media platforms. At this stage the social media icons only link to the respective platform home pages, as the Barefoot Business profiles have not been completed on the respective sites (This will be updated as part of future work on the site).



### Home

The home page features in image of the book itself. This ensures the subject of the website is clear to the visitor right away. With this image is a headline phrased as a question, to draw the visitor in. This leads to a short introduction to the book, as well as a list of key outcomes for the visitor, should they read the book.

Next on the Home page is the praise for Barefoot Business and the foreword from the book itself. This aims to draw the visitor into the book, even before they have a copy in their hand. It also helps to build credibility for the book and the author.

At the bottom of the Home page is a short bio of the author, which includes professional as well as personal information, including a photo of the author, to build familiarity.

In this section the visitor also has the option to contact the author via a webform.



### 3 Key Systems

The 3 Key Systems page is a long-form article focussing on the main concept the book is based on.

The aim of the article is two-fold:

1 - Allow the visitor to get a real grasp of what Barefoot Business has to offer, allowing them to make a decision about buying the book, with a real understanding of what they will be investing their time spent reading in.

2 - Allow those visitors who are ready to take the next step, to simply skip reading the book and contact the author directly, already understanding the type of work the author does.

The same bio section and contact form used on the Home page is repeated at the bottom of the 3 Key Systems page.



### Get In Touch  

The Get In Touch page gives the visitor two options as next steps:

1 - Contact the author with an interest of working together - this is done by completing the form at the bottom of the page.

2 - Explore the collection of podcast interview episodes the author is featured on, with the aim of allowing the visitor to learn more about the author and his work, which can then lead to the visitor contacting the author directly.

## Color Contrast 

I used the WAVE Colour Contrast Accessibility Validator to check the contrast of the site.The initial colour for the site matched the blue colour used for the book cover, but this proved to be of insufficient contrast when used as a text colour or background colour.

![Failed Contrast Test Result Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pieterkdevilliers/barefoot-business-book/main/assets/images/readme-images/contract-failing.webp)

The colour was replaced with a darker, greyer hue, which provides a much better contrast and better accessibility.
